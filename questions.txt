is a malicious attempt to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network. - cyberattack
is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. - firewall
is the process of converting plain text into coded text to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. - encryption
is a malicious program that can infect a computer system and spread from one system to another. - virus
is a term used to describe any malicious software designed to harm or disrupt computer systems. - malware
a type of cyberattack that involves tricking people into giving away sensitive information such as passwords and credit card details. - phishing
is a security measure that requires users to provide two forms of identification to gain access to a system or network. - two-factor authentication/2fa
is a secure, encrypted network connection that allows users to access a private network from a public network, such as the internet. - virtual private network/vpn
is a cyberattack that involves overwhelming a computer system or network with traffic, making it unavailable to users. - denial-of-service/dos
is a type of DoS attack that uses multiple compromised computers to flood a system or network with traffic, making it unavailable to users. - distributed denial-of-service/ddos
is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. - ransomware
is a network of infected computers that are controlled remotely by a cybercriminal. - botnet
is a weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. - vulnerability
is a software update designed to fix vulnerabilities or bugs in a program or operating system. - patch
is a tactic used by cybercriminals to manipulate people into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that are against their interests. - social engineering
is a previously unknown vulnerability in software that is discovered by cybercriminals and exploited before a patch is released. - zero-day vulnerability
is a process of evaluating a system or network to identify vulnerabilities and potential security risks. - security audit
is a simulated attack on a system or network to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. - penetration test
is a set of conditions that determine how traffic is allowed or blocked through a firewall. - firewall rule
is a set of guidelines and procedures that govern the protection of sensitive information and computer systems. - security policy
is an incident where sensitive, confidential or protected data is accessed or disclosed without authorization, either accidentally or intentionally. - data breach
is a type of cyberattack where an attacker intercepts communications between two parties to eavesdrop or modify the conversation. - man-in-the-middle attack
is any event that violates an organization's security policies, compromises its assets or operations, or poses a threat to its confidentiality, integrity, or availability. - security incident
is a type of security incident where an unauthorized entity gains access to an organization's network, system, or data. - security breach
is a potential danger or risk that exploits vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or applications, and can result in harm to individuals, organizations, or society. - cyber threat
is a criminal activity that involves the use of digital technology or the internet, such as hacking, identity theft, fraud, or cyber espionage. - cybercrime
is a device or software application that generates one time passwords, cryptographic keys, or other authentication codes to verify a user's identity and protect access to a system or network. - security token
is a documented set of procedures and guidelines that outline the steps to be taken in case of a security incident or breach. - security incident response plan
is a process of identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system or network, and recommending mitigation measures to reduce the risk of exploitation. - vulnerability assessment
is a program designed to educate employees and users about the risks and best practices of cybersecurity, to improve their behavior and reduce the likelihood of security incidents. - security awareness training
is a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols that is difficult to guess, and not used for other accounts or purposes. - secure password
is a digital document that verifies the identity of an individual, organization, or website, and is used to establish secure communication and transactions over the internet. - digital certificate
is a mathematical code that verifies the authenticity and integrity of a digital document or message, and provides a non repudiation mechanism to prevent denial of responsibility. - digital signature
is a decoy system or network that is designed to attract and trap cybercriminals, and to collect information about their methods and intentions. - honeypot
is a web service that issues and manages security tokens for identity and access management, and provides authentication and authorization services across different applications and systems. - security token service
is the ability of an organization to withstand, adapt to, and recover from cyberattacks or other disruptive events, and to maintain the continuity of its operations and services. - cyber resilience
is the knowledge and analysis of cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and malicious actors, and the use of this information to inform security strategies and defenses. - Threat intelligence
is a virtualized or isolated environment that allows applications or code to be tested or run in a controlled and secure way, without affecting the production system or network. - sandbox environment
a security mechanism that restricts or grants access to resources or services based on the identity, role, or permissions of the user or entity. - access control
is a security tool that monitors network or system activity for suspicious behavior or events, and alerts security personnel or triggers an automated response. - intrusion detection system
is a network security device that filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined rules or policies, to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage. - firewall
is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using mathematical algorithms, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit or storage. - encryption
is the process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a secret key or algorithm, to recover the original data. - decryption
is a cyberattack that aims to disrupt or disable a system or network by overwhelming it with traffic or requests, rendering it inaccessible or unusable. - denial-of-service/DOS
a type of malicious software that is designed to harm or exploit a system or network, such as viruses, worms, Trojans, or ransomware. - malware
a type of cyberattack that exploits human psychology and behavior, such as phishing, pretexting, or baiting, to trick or manipulate users into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. - social engineering
is a security mechanism that requires users to provide multiple forms of identification or verification, such as a password, a security token, a biometric factor, or a smart card, to access a system or network. - multi-factor authentication
A type of insurance that provides coverage for losses or damages related to cyberattacks or data breaches, such as legal fees, notification costs, or business interruption. - cyber insurance
